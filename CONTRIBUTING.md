## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LucaLumetti/ZipLeague/issues) page
- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Include relevant system information (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Submitting Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Commit your changes with a clear commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of changes"
   ```
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

### Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new features when applicable

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure all tests pass
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix
- Update documentation if necessary

## Development Setup

### Running Tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Database Setup

The project uses PostgreSQL for both development and production. When using Docker Compose, the database is automatically configured. To reset the database:

```bash
docker compose down -v  # Remove volumes to delete database data
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

For local development without Docker, ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and configure the database settings in your `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

### Docker Development

Alternatively, you can use Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## TODO - Upcoming Features

This section outlines planned features and improvements that contributors can work on.

### üîÑ **User-Player Integration**

**Current Issue**: Users (Django auth) and Players are completely separate entities. Registered users are treated as admins, while Players are just data objects for match tracking.

**Goal**: Merge User and Player models so registered users become players automatically, with proper permission management. When someone creates an account, they should automatically become a player in the league with appropriate permissions to participate in matches. Need to decide how to handle the registration of a user without them taking any action (e.g., a player plays just once, and forgot to register. An admin can register them, and the user can later set a password somehow, maybe using the forgot password).

### üîê **Forgot Password System**

**Current Issue**: No password reset functionality in login system.

**Goal**: Add a "Forgot Password?" link to the login page that allows users to reset their password via email. This should integrate with Django's built-in password reset functionality.

### üë§ **User Profile Images**

**Goal**: Allow users to upload and display profile images. Player detail pages and lists should show these images, with fallback avatars (showing initials or a default image) when no profile picture is uploaded. Images should be properly validated and resized for consistency.

### üèÜ **Tournament System**

**Current Issue**: Only basic match tracking exists. No way to organize matches into tournaments or track tournament-specific statistics.

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive tournament system that allows:
- Admins to create tournaments with different formats (single elimination, double elimination, round robin, etc.)
- Players to register for tournaments
- Automatic bracket generation and match scheduling
- Tournament-specific statistics and leaderboards
- Tournament progress tracking and results

### üîß **Additional Improvements**

- **API Development**: Add REST API endpoints
- **Real-time Features**: Live match updates and notifications using WebSockets
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Player performance analytics and data visualization
- **Enhanced Testing**: Increase test coverage and add integration tests
